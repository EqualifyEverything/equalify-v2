# Guided Demo 

Equalify is built to manage many web accessibility issues.

Blake will guide our target users through this demo. (We're targeting project managers and accessibility managers - those who use SiteImprove.)

The particular usecase should be tooled to any user its being demoed with.

By default, the demo covers the use case of an accessibilty lead (Lucy) at a university (Berkely) wanting to survey a few pages of a new site they need to review, before setting up a new audit for monthly OCR reviews with custom checks on additional pages. They also will receive notifications so they can track their team's progress over time. The user  relies on screen readers.

## Steps
Open [1-home-first_visit.html](1-home.html) in your browser, then follow these steps:

1. Select Build Audit.
2. Sign in as "lgreco@berkeley.edu," password "pass".
3. Add pages https://update.lib.berkeley.edu/ and https://www-stg.berkeley.edu
4. Click next step.
5. Add checks the last two checks "empty-alt-elements" and "Unique Link and Button Text"
6. Click next step.
7. Save the audit as "Lucy's Review" with "Monhtly" frequency and notifications on.

Demo is done.

## Objectives
